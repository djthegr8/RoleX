*The official repository of TradeMemer, a bot that aims to ease trading for all Dank Memer. We <3 open source, so here it is!*
Just add a file called token.txt with your token for replication, in the folder printed when you run it.    
*I have tried to make the code understandable, but as of now it isn't as detailed and commented as it should be...*    
### Setup for server    
Although the bot is capable of making a new channel when given permissions to do so, however if you don't want to give admin/Manage Channels perms, you should make a channel called *marketplace* (case insensitive) which will be where the bot embeds will be printed.   
### Commands    
#### 1. !trade (quantity: integer) (item: string) (price: integer)
This command is the basis of the bot. It takes the user's input irrespective of the channel, and prints a brief and clear embed in the *marketplace* channel. It should be ensured that the bot's item-name be a single word, we suggest using hyphenated words for multi-word itemname.      
     
**Example:**     
!trade 3 brains 20000    
#### 2. !idea (suggestion: list of strings)
This command DMs the idea to our (DMCG) server's Owner (IMSlender) and this bot's Lead Dev (DJ001) 
        
**Example:**     
!idea You guys should make a new cmd      
#### 3. !vote
We aren't at top.gg yet, so we don't really have a voting system, but this gives the link to our botsondiscord page.    
#### 4. !ping
This simply gives the bot's ping.      
### Credits and Links     
The bot is made by DJ001#0915, and was tested and played around with in the server [Dank Memer Casino and Giveaways](https://discord.me/dmcg)

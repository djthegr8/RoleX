*This server is up for all people who use and <3 our bot, and also those who have suggestions!!!*
### Setup for server     
Although the bot is capable of making a new channel when given permissions to do so, however if you don't want to give admin/Manage Channels perms, you should make a channel called *marketplace* (case insensitive) which will be where the bot embeds will be printed.   
### Trading Commands     
#### 1. !trade (quantity: integer) (item: string) (price/barter-item: string)
This command is the basis of the bot. It takes the user's input irrespective of the channel, and prints a brief and clear embed in the *marketplace* channel. It should be ensured that the bot's item-name be a single word, we suggest using hyphenated words for multi-word itemname.      
     
**Example:**     
!trade 3 brains 20000     

#### 2. !buying (quantity: integer) (item: string) (price/barter-item: string)      
This is a public demand command for requesting a sale, when you wish to buy something. It works exactly the same way as the trade command.

### Non-trading commands
#### 1. !idea (suggestion: list of strings)
This command DMs the idea to our (DMCG) server's Owner (IMSlender) and this bot's Lead Dev (DJ001) 
        
**Example:**     
!idea You guys should make a new cmd      
#### 2. !vote
We aren't at top.gg yet, so we don't really have a voting system, but this gives the link to our botsondiscord page.    
#### 3. !ping
This simply gives the bot's ping.
